    This policy validates that all containers have set memory and CPU requests and limits.
    Resource requests prevents resource starvation of the pod, if other pods on node are misbehaving.
    Resource limits specifies maximum quantity of resources that can be aquired by given container, defending other pods from resource starvation.
    Only presence of settings is checked, can be set to arbitrary value.
