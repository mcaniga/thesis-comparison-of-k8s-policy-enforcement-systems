apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mount-host-path
  annotations:
    readableName: Pod with host mount
    vulnerabilityReason: Host mount exposes files or directories from host filesystem. Attacker can read, modify or delete this information from container (only read if readOnly). Violates all three attributes of CIA triad (only confidentiality if readOnly).
