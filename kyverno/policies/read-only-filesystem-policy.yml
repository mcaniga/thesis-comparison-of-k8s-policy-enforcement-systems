    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      A read-only root file system helps to enforce an immutable infrastructure strategy;
      the container only needs to write on the mounted volume that persists the state.
      An immutable root filesystem can also prevent malicious binaries from writing to the
      host system. This policy validates that containers define a securityContext
      with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`.
spec:
  # Specifies action done when validation fails
  # Allowed values: 'Audit' (report but allow) | 'Enforce' (don't allow to create invalid resource)
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  # Specifies if policy applies also on already existing resources
  # If set to true, then violations are reported (but existing resources are not blocked - 'audit' semantics)
